Fusion [/0029-5515/40/3y/316] 40 557 ). There are three typical onset conditions for these modes, given in order of increasing neoclassical drive required for mode onset: triggering by energetic particle modes, triggering by edge localized modes and cases where the modes appear to grow without a trigger. In all cases, the required drive increases with toroidal rotation shear, implying a stabilizing effect from the shear.}

The paper presents a new algorithm which allows the shape evolution of a discharge to be entirely preprogrammed. The algorithm computes poloidal field coil voltages as functions of time, using magnetic measurements made close to the vessel wall. No preprogrammed coil current wave forms are required. By simulating the start-up phase of typical TCV tokamak discharges, it is shown that the actual shape evolution follows closely the preprogrammed one. X-points can be specified at arbitrary positions. Active stabilization of the dominant vertical mode is achieved by a conventional PD feedback loop. The optimization of feedback coefficients, the trade-off between shape accuracy and power dissipation in the poloidal field coils, as well as the computing power requirements for implementing the algorithm in a real experiment are discussed.}

The effect of eddy currents on shape identification is investigated in dynamic simulations. The isoflux control scheme and a standard \{PID\} control law are adopted for the development of a model shape control system. It is shown that appropriate weighting factors of poloidal field coils, incorporating the efficacy of each coil to a shape control point, can significantly reduce the total feedback power required for a shape control action.

  abstract={The high-performance operational goals of NSTX-U will require development of advanced feedback control algorithms, including control of β N and the safety factor profile. In this work, a novel approach to simultaneously controlling β N and the value of the safety factor on the magnetic axis, q 0 , through manipulation of the plasma boundary shape and total beam power, is proposed. Simulations of the proposed scheme show promising results and motivate future experimental implementation and eventual integration into a more complex current profile control scheme planned to include actuation of individual beam powers, density, and loop voltage. As part of this work, a flexible framework for closed loop simulations within the high-fidelity code TRANSP was developed. The framework, used here to identify control-design-oriented models and to tune and test the proposed controller, exploits many of the predictive capabilities of TRANSP and provides a means for performing control calculations based on user-supplied data (controller matrices, target waveforms, etc). The flexible framework should enable high-fidelity testing of a variety of control algorithms, thereby reducing the amount of expensive experimental time needed to implement new control algorithms on NSTX-U and other devices.}

  abstract={Real-time simultaneous control of several radially distributed magnetic and kinetic plasma parameters is being investigated on JET, in view of developing integrated control of advanced tokamak scenarios. This paper describes the new model-based profile controller which has been implemented during the 2006–2007 experimental campaigns. The controller aims to use the combination of heating and current drive (H&CD) systems—and optionally the poloidal field (PF) system—in an optimal way to regulate the evolution of plasma parameter profiles such as the safety factor, q ( x ), and gyro-normalized temperature gradient, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0029-5515/48/10/106001/nf269530in001.gif] {\rho _{\rm Te}^*(x)} . In the first part of the paper, a technique for the experimental identification of a minimal dynamic plasma model is described, taking into account the physical structure and couplings of the transport equations, but making no quantitative assumptions on the transport coefficients or on their dependences. To cope with the high dimensionality of the state space and the large ratio between the time scales involved, the model identification procedure and the controller design both make use of the theory of singularly perturbed systems by means of a two-time-scale approximation. The second part of the paper provides the theoretical basis for the controller design. The profile controller is articulated around two composite feedback loops operating on the magnetic and kinetic time scales, respectively, and supplemented by a feedforward compensation of density variations. For any chosen set of target profiles, the closest self-consistent state achievable with the available actuators is uniquely defined. It is reached, with no steady state offset, through a near-optimal proportional-integral control algorithm. Conventional optimal control is recovered in the limiting case where the ratio of the plasma confinement time to the resistive diffusion time tends to zero. Closed-loop simulations of the controller response have been performed in preparation for experiments, and typical results are shown. Finally, in the last section of the paper, the first experimental results using this dynamic-model approach to control the plasma current and the safety factor profile on JET, either with the three H&CD systems or also with the PF system as an additional actuator, are presented and discussed.}

  abstract={An integrated plasma profile control strategy, ARTAEMIS , is being developed for extrapolating present-day advanced tokamak (AT) scenarios to steady-state operation. The approach is based on semi-empirical modelling and was initially explored on JET (Moreau et al 2008 Nucl. Fusion [/0029-5515/48] 48 106001 ). This paper deals with the general applicability of this strategy for simultaneous magnetic and kinetic control on various tokamaks. The determination of the device-specific, control-oriented models that are needed to compute optimal controller matrices for a given operation scenario is discussed. The methodology is generic and can be applied to any device, with different sets of heating and current drive actuators, controlled variables and profiles. The system identification algorithms take advantage of the large ratio between the magnetic and thermal diffusion time scales and have been recently applied to both JT-60U and DIII-D data. On JT-60U, an existing series of high bootstrap current (~70\%), 0.9 MA non-inductive AT discharges was used. The actuators consisted of four groups of neutral beam injectors aimed at perpendicular injection (on-axis and off-axis), and co-current tangential injection (also on-axis and off-axis). On DIII-D, dedicated system identification experiments were carried out in the loop voltage ( V ext ) control mode (as opposed to current control) to avoid feedback in the response data from the primary circuit. The reference plasma state was that of a 0.9 MA AT scenario which had been optimized to combine non-inductive current fractions near unity with 3.5 < β N < 3.9, bootstrap current fractions larger than 65\% and H 98( y ,2) = 1.5. Actuators other than V ext were co-current, counter-current and balanced neutral beam injection, and electron cyclotron current drive. Power and loop voltage modulations resulted in dynamic variations of the plasma current between 0.7 and 1.2 MA. It is concluded that the response of essential plasma parameter profiles to specific actuators of a given device can be satisfactorily identified from a small set of experiments. This provides, for control purposes, a readily available alternative to first-principles plasma modelling.}

  abstract={This paper describes a new technique which has been implemented on the JET tokamak to investigate integrated real-time control of several plasma profiles simultaneously (such as current, temperature and pressure) and reports the results of the first experimental tests. The profiles are handled through their projection on a suitable basis of functions according to the Galerkin scheme. Their response to three actuators (heating and current drive powers injected in the plasma) is linearized in an experimentally deduced multi-input multi-output model. The singular value decomposition of this model operator allows us to design a distributed-parameter real-time controller which maximizes the steady state decoupling of the multiple feedback loops. It enables us to control several coupled profiles simultaneously, with some degree of fuzziness to let the plasma evolve towards an accessible non-linear state which is the closest to the requested one, despite a limited number of actuators. The first experiments using these techniques show that different current and electron temperature profiles can be obtained and sustained by the controller during a closed-loop operation time window. Future improvements and perspectives are briefly mentioned.}

New algorithms using a truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD) of a linearized model operator and retaining the distributed nature of the system have been implemented in the JET control system. Their simplest versions have been applied to the control of the current density profile in reversed shear plasmas using three heating and current drive actuators (neutral beam injection, ion cyclotron resonant frequency heating and lower hybrid current drive). Successful control of the safety factor profile has been achieved in the quasi-steady-state, on a timescale of the order of the current redistribution time. How the TSVD algorithm will be used in the forthcoming campaigns for the simultaneous control of the current profile and of the ITB temperature gradient is discussed in some detail, but this has not yet been attempted in the present pioneering experiments.}

abstract = "The \{SCED\} code solves the equilibrium equations for a Tokamak axisymmetric configuration and the plasma diffusion equations. The equilibrium system takes into account the presence of a magnetic circuit made of iron, the currents in the poloidal coils and the plasma pressure and toroidal field profiles. The plasma boundary is a free boundary defined by its contact with a limiter. A variational formulation of the problem is written and the equations of the poloidal flux ψ are solved by a finite element method; the Picard and the Newton algorithms are tested for the treatment of the non-linearities and compared on \{TFR\} and \{JET\} equilibrium configurations. The variation of the plasma position with respect to the currents in the coils is then studied by a continuation method and the link between the convergence of the Picard method and the stability of the plasma motions is proved. The evolution problem takes into account the induction of the primary coils and the penetration of the eddy currents in the vacuum vessel. The 2D diffusion equations for the electronic and ionic densities and temperatures and for the poloidal flux are written in terms of the toroidal flux by averaging over the magnetic surfaces. These equations are solved by an implicit scheme in time and by a finite difference scheme in space; the non-linearities are treated by the Newton method. The coupling between the equilibrium system and the diffusion equations enables one to follow the evolution of the plasma boundary.

  abstract={The vertical stability of an elongated tokamak plasma with infinite conductivity is numerically investigated under simple assumptions, in toroidal co-ordinates. The rectangular configuration is stable for an elongation ratio of less than 3 ~ 4, depending upon the current profile. It is shown that the stabilization at high elongation ratio is related to the rotational-transform constraint.}

  abstract={The production and equilibrium of tokamak plasmas with vertically elongated cross-sections are described. Axisymmetric instabilities, which are controlled by a passive feedback system, restrict the semiaxis ratio to less than 1.5. Both the appearance and growth times of these instabilities are theoretically predicted. Poloidal magnetic field oscillations are shown to confirm the plasma shape deduced from equilibrium calculations. The poloidal beta, central electron temperature and overall energy confinement time increase with increasing semi-axis ratio.}

  abstract={The National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) is being built at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory to test the fusion physics principles for the spherical torus concept at the MA level. The NSTX nominal plasma parameters are R 0 = 85 cm, a = 67 cm, R/a ≥ 1.26, B t = 3 kG, I p = 1 MA, q 95 = 14, elongation κ ≤ 2.2, triangularity δ ≤ 0.5 and a plasma pulse length of up to 5 s. The plasma heating/current drive tools are high harmonic fast wave (6 MW, 5 s), neutral beam injection (5 MW, 80 keV, 5 s) and coaxial helicity injection. Theoretical calculations predict that NSTX should provide exciting possibilities for exploring a number of important new physics regimes, including very high plasma β, naturally high plasma elongation, high bootstrap current fraction, absolute magnetic well and high pressure driven sheared flow. In addition, the NSTX programme plans to explore fully non-inductive plasma startup as well as a dispersive scrape-off layer for heat and particle flux handling.}

  abstract={Resistive wall mode (RWM) instabilities are found to be a limiting factor in advanced tokamak regimes with low internal inductance. Even small amplitude modes can affect the rotation profile and the performance of these ELMing H mode discharges. Although complete stabilization of the RWM by plasma rotation has not yet been observed, several discharges with increased beam momentum and power injection sustained good steady state performance for record durations. The first investigation of active feedback control of the RWM has shown promising results: the leakage of radial magnetic flux through the resistive wall can be successfully controlled and the duration of the high beta phase can be prolonged. The results provide a comparative test of several approaches to active feedback control, and are being used to benchmark the analysis and computational models of active control.}

  abstract={Two important effects of MHD fluctuations in the RFP and tokamak are current generation (the dynamo effect) and mode locking. In the T1 and MST RFP experiments new results reveal the mode dynamics underlying these phenomena. In T1 the effect of specific magnetic Fourier modes on the current density profile is evident. In MST, the MHD dynamo term ( delta v* delta B) is measured in the plasma edge, and found to account for the time dependence of the edge current throughout a sawtooth cycle. As edge resistivity is increased in T1 the fluctuation amplitude increases to maintain the dynamo-driven current, as expected from MHD computation. The modes responsible for the dynamo often lock to the local magnetic field error at the vertical cut in MST. The plasma rotation velocity has been measured with a fast Doppler spectrometer to a time resolution of 1 mu s. The plasma rotation and mode phase velocity are remarkably well-correlated, with both slowing, in the presence of an impulsive field error, in a 100 mu s timescale.}

  abstract={Dedicated experiments on TF ripple effects on the performance of tokamak plasmas have been carried out at JET. The TF ripple was found to have a profound effect on the plasma rotation. The central Mach number, M , defined as the ratio of the rotation velocity and the thermal velocity, was found to drop as a function of TF ripple amplitude (δ) from an average value of M = 0.40–0.55 for operations at the standard JET ripple of δ = 0.08% to M = 0.25–0.40 for δ = 0.5% and M = 0.1–0.3 for δ = 1%. TF ripple effects should be considered when estimating the plasma rotation in ITER. With standard co-current injection of neutral beam injection (NBI), plasmas were found to rotate in the co-current direction. However, for higher TF ripple amplitudes (δ ~ 1%) an area of counter rotation developed at the edge of the plasma, while the core kept its co-rotation. The edge counter rotation was found to depend, besides on the TF ripple amplitude, on the edge temperature. The observed reduction of toroidal plasma rotation with increasing TF ripple could partly be explained by TF ripple induced losses of energetic ions, injected by NBI. However, the calculated torque due to these losses was insufficient to explain the observed counter rotation and its scaling with edge parameters. It is suggested that additional TF ripple induced losses of thermal ions contribute to this effect.}

title={Principal component analysis in linear systems: Controllability, observability, and model reduction},
year={1981},
volume={26},

pages={17-32},
abstract={Kalman's minimal realization theory involves geometric objects (controllable, unobservable subspaces) which are subject to structural instability. Specifically, arbitrarily small perturbations in a model may cause a change in the dimensions of the associated subspaces. This situation is manifested in computational difficulties which arise in attempts to apply textbook algorithms for computing a minimal realization. Structural instability associated with geometric theories is not unique to control; it arises in the theory of linear equations as well. In this setting, the computational problems have been studied for decades and excellent tools have been developed for coping with the situation. One of the main goals of this paper is to call attention to principal component analysis (Hotelling, 1933), and an algorithm (Golub and Reinsch, 1970) for computing the singular value decompositon of a matrix. Together they form a powerful tool for coping with structural instability in dynamic systems. As developed in this paper, principal component analysis is a technique for analyzing signals. (Singular value decomposition provides the computational machinery.) For this reason, Kalman's minimal realization theory is recast in terms of responses to injected signals. Application of the signal analysis to controllability and observability leads to a coordinate system in which the "internally balanced" model has special properties. For asymptotically stable systems, this yields working approximations ofX_{c}, X_{bar{o}}, the controllable and unobservable subspaces. It is proposed that a natural first step in model reduction is to apply the mechanics of minimal realization using these working subspaces.},

  abstract={In this work we develop an artificial neural network (ANN) for the feedback stabilization of a thermonuclear reactor at nearly ignited burn conditions. A volume-averaged zero-dimensional nonlinear model is used to represent the time evolution of the electron density, the relative density of alpha particles and the temperature of the plasma, where a particular scaling law for the energy confinement time previously used by other authors, was adopted. The control actions include the concurrent modulation of the D-T refuelling rate, the injection of a neutral He-4 beam and an auxiliary heating power modulation, which are constrained to take values within a maximum and minimum levels. For this purpose a feedforward multilayer artificial neural network with sigmoidal activation function is trained using a back-propagation through-time technique. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the behaviour of the resulting ANN-dynamical system configuration. It is concluded that the resulting ANN can successfully stabilize the nonlinear model of the thermonuclear reactor at nearly ignited conditions for temperature and density departures significantly far from their nominal operating values. The NN-dynamical system configuration is shown to be robust with respect to the thermalization time of the alpha particles for perturbations within the region used to train the NN.}

  abstract={In order for ITER to be capable of operating in advanced tokamak operating regimes, characterized by a high fusion gain, good plasma confinement, magnetohydrodynamic stability and a non-inductively driven plasma current, for extended periods of time, several challenging plasma control problems still need to be solved. Setting up a suitable toroidal current density profile in the tokamak is key for one possible advanced operating scenario characterized by non-inductive sustainment of the plasma current. At the DIII-D tokamak, the goal is to create the desired current profile during the ramp-up and early flat-top phases of the plasma discharge and then actively maintain this target profile for the remainder of the discharge. The evolution in time of the toroidal current profile in tokamaks is related to the evolution of the poloidal magnetic flux profile, which is modelled in normalized cylindrical coordinates using a first-principles, nonlinear, dynamic partial differential equation (PDE) referred to as the magnetic diffusion equation. The magnetic diffusion equation is combined with empirical correlations developed from physical observations and experimental data from DIII-D for the electron temperature, the plasma resistivity and the non-inductive current drive to develop a simplified, control-oriented, nonlinear, dynamic PDE model of the poloidal flux profile evolution valid for low confinement mode discharges. In this work, we synthesize a robust feedback controller to reject disturbances and track a desired reference trajectory of the poloidal magnetic flux gradient profile by employing the control-oriented model of the system. A singular value decomposition of the static gain matrix of the plant model is utilized to identify the most relevant control channels and is combined with the dynamic response of system around a given operating trajectory to design the feedback controller. A general framework for real-time feedforward + feedback control of magnetic and kinetic plasma profiles was implemented in the DIII-D Plasma Control System and was used to demonstrate the ability of the feedback controller to control the toroidal current profile evolution in the DIII-D tokamak. These experiments constitute the first time ever a first-principles-driven, model-based, closed-loop magnetic profile controller was successfully implemented and tested in a tokamak device.}

  abstract={A comprehensive transport equation for the evolution of toroidal rotation in tokamak plasmas is developed self-consistently from the two-fluid momentum equations taking account of the constraints imposed by faster time scale processes. The resultant plasma toroidal rotation equation includes the effects of collision-induced perpendicular viscosities, anomalous transport due to microturbulence in the plasma, momentum sources and collision-based parallel viscous forces due to 3D non-axisymmetric (NA) magnetic field components produced by external fields and MHD-type instabilities in the plasma. Non-resonant NA fields produce a toroidal torque throughout the plasma that relaxes the toroidal flow to an 'intrinsic' or 'offset' ion-temperature-gradient diamagnetic-type flow in the direction counter to the plasma current. A NA resonant field error causes a toroidal torque localized near its rational surface. The combination of resonant and non-resonant NA field components is found to predict scalings for error field penetration and mode locking thresholds that are in closer agreement with empirical data from tokamak plasmas.}

While these techniques consume a substantial amount of computer time, they take into account a number of significant, and normally neglected, effects. Examples of these effects are reionization of escaping charge exchanged beam particles, finite fast ion orbit excursions, beam deposition through collisions of beam neutrals with circulating beam ions, and the transport of thermal neutrals in the plasma due to charge changing collisions with beam ions.

  abstract={The National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) is being built at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory to test the fusion physics principles for the spherical torus concept at the MA level. The NSTX nominal plasma parameters are R 0 = 85 cm, a = 67 cm, R/a ≥ 1.26, B t = 3 kG, I p = 1 MA, q 95 = 14, elongation κ ≤ 2.2, triangularity δ ≤ 0.5 and a plasma pulse length of up to 5 s. The plasma heating/current drive tools are high harmonic fast wave (6 MW, 5 s), neutral beam injection (5 MW, 80 keV, 5 s) and coaxial helicity injection. Theoretical calculations predict that NSTX should provide exciting possibilities for exploring a number of important new physics regimes, including very high plasma β, naturally high plasma elongation, high bootstrap current fraction, absolute magnetic well and high pressure driven sheared flow. In addition, the NSTX programme plans to explore fully non-inductive plasma startup as well as a dispersive scrape-off layer for heat and particle flux handling.}

  abstract={Resistive wall mode (RWM) instabilities are found to be a limiting factor in advanced tokamak regimes with low internal inductance. Even small amplitude modes can affect the rotation profile and the performance of these ELMing H mode discharges. Although complete stabilization of the RWM by plasma rotation has not yet been observed, several discharges with increased beam momentum and power injection sustained good steady state performance for record durations. The first investigation of active feedback control of the RWM has shown promising results: the leakage of radial magnetic flux through the resistive wall can be successfully controlled and the duration of the high beta phase can be prolonged. The results provide a comparative test of several approaches to active feedback control, and are being used to benchmark the analysis and computational models of active control.}

  abstract={Two important effects of MHD fluctuations in the RFP and tokamak are current generation (the dynamo effect) and mode locking. In the T1 and MST RFP experiments new results reveal the mode dynamics underlying these phenomena. In T1 the effect of specific magnetic Fourier modes on the current density profile is evident. In MST, the MHD dynamo term ( delta v* delta B) is measured in the plasma edge, and found to account for the time dependence of the edge current throughout a sawtooth cycle. As edge resistivity is increased in T1 the fluctuation amplitude increases to maintain the dynamo-driven current, as expected from MHD computation. The modes responsible for the dynamo often lock to the local magnetic field error at the vertical cut in MST. The plasma rotation velocity has been measured with a fast Doppler spectrometer to a time resolution of 1 mu s. The plasma rotation and mode phase velocity are remarkably well-correlated, with both slowing, in the presence of an impulsive field error, in a 100 mu s timescale.}

  abstract={Dedicated experiments on TF ripple effects on the performance of tokamak plasmas have been carried out at JET. The TF ripple was found to have a profound effect on the plasma rotation. The central Mach number, M , defined as the ratio of the rotation velocity and the thermal velocity, was found to drop as a function of TF ripple amplitude (δ) from an average value of M = 0.40–0.55 for operations at the standard JET ripple of δ = 0.08% to M = 0.25–0.40 for δ = 0.5% and M = 0.1–0.3 for δ = 1%. TF ripple effects should be considered when estimating the plasma rotation in ITER. With standard co-current injection of neutral beam injection (NBI), plasmas were found to rotate in the co-current direction. However, for higher TF ripple amplitudes (δ ~ 1%) an area of counter rotation developed at the edge of the plasma, while the core kept its co-rotation. The edge counter rotation was found to depend, besides on the TF ripple amplitude, on the edge temperature. The observed reduction of toroidal plasma rotation with increasing TF ripple could partly be explained by TF ripple induced losses of energetic ions, injected by NBI. However, the calculated torque due to these losses was insufficient to explain the observed counter rotation and its scaling with edge parameters. It is suggested that additional TF ripple induced losses of thermal ions contribute to this effect.}

title={Principal component analysis in linear systems: Controllability, observability, and model reduction},
year={1981},
volume={26},
number={1},
pages={17-32},
abstract={Kalman's minimal realization theory involves geometric objects (controllable, unobservable subspaces) which are subject to structural instability. Specifically, arbitrarily small perturbations in a model may cause a change in the dimensions of the associated subspaces. This situation is manifested in computational difficulties which arise in attempts to apply textbook algorithms for computing a minimal realization. Structural instability associated with geometric theories is not unique to control; it arises in the theory of linear equations as well. In this setting, the computational problems have been studied for decades and excellent tools have been developed for coping with the situation. One of the main goals of this paper is to call attention to principal component analysis (Hotelling, 1933), and an algorithm (Golub and Reinsch, 1970) for computing the singular value decompositon of a matrix. Together they form a powerful tool for coping with structural instability in dynamic systems. As developed in this paper, principal component analysis is a technique for analyzing signals. (Singular value decomposition provides the computational machinery.) For this reason, Kalman's minimal realization theory is recast in terms of responses to injected signals. Application of the signal analysis to controllability and observability leads to a coordinate system in which the "internally balanced" model has special properties. For asymptotically stable systems, this yields working approximations ofX_{c}, X_{bar{o}}, the controllable and unobservable subspaces. It is proposed that a natural first step in model reduction is to apply the mechanics of minimal realization using these working subspaces.},

  abstract={In this work we develop an artificial neural network (ANN) for the feedback stabilization of a thermonuclear reactor at nearly ignited burn conditions. A volume-averaged zero-dimensional nonlinear model is used to represent the time evolution of the electron density, the relative density of alpha particles and the temperature of the plasma, where a particular scaling law for the energy confinement time previously used by other authors, was adopted. The control actions include the concurrent modulation of the D-T refuelling rate, the injection of a neutral He-4 beam and an auxiliary heating power modulation, which are constrained to take values within a maximum and minimum levels. For this purpose a feedforward multilayer artificial neural network with sigmoidal activation function is trained using a back-propagation through-time technique. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the behaviour of the resulting ANN-dynamical system configuration. It is concluded that the resulting ANN can successfully stabilize the nonlinear model of the thermonuclear reactor at nearly ignited conditions for temperature and density departures significantly far from their nominal operating values. The NN-dynamical system configuration is shown to be robust with respect to the thermalization time of the alpha particles for perturbations within the region used to train the NN.}

  abstract={In order for ITER to be capable of operating in advanced tokamak operating regimes, characterized by a high fusion gain, good plasma confinement, magnetohydrodynamic stability and a non-inductively driven plasma current, for extended periods of time, several challenging plasma control problems still need to be solved. Setting up a suitable toroidal current density profile in the tokamak is key for one possible advanced operating scenario characterized by non-inductive sustainment of the plasma current. At the DIII-D tokamak, the goal is to create the desired current profile during the ramp-up and early flat-top phases of the plasma discharge and then actively maintain this target profile for the remainder of the discharge. The evolution in time of the toroidal current profile in tokamaks is related to the evolution of the poloidal magnetic flux profile, which is modelled in normalized cylindrical coordinates using a first-principles, nonlinear, dynamic partial differential equation (PDE) referred to as the magnetic diffusion equation. The magnetic diffusion equation is combined with empirical correlations developed from physical observations and experimental data from DIII-D for the electron temperature, the plasma resistivity and the non-inductive current drive to develop a simplified, control-oriented, nonlinear, dynamic PDE model of the poloidal flux profile evolution valid for low confinement mode discharges. In this work, we synthesize a robust feedback controller to reject disturbances and track a desired reference trajectory of the poloidal magnetic flux gradient profile by employing the control-oriented model of the system. A singular value decomposition of the static gain matrix of the plant model is utilized to identify the most relevant control channels and is combined with the dynamic response of system around a given operating trajectory to design the feedback controller. A general framework for real-time feedforward + feedback control of magnetic and kinetic plasma profiles was implemented in the DIII-D Plasma Control System and was used to demonstrate the ability of the feedback controller to control the toroidal current profile evolution in the DIII-D tokamak. These experiments constitute the first time ever a first-principles-driven, model-based, closed-loop magnetic profile controller was successfully implemented and tested in a tokamak device.}

  abstract={A comprehensive transport equation for the evolution of toroidal rotation in tokamak plasmas is developed self-consistently from the two-fluid momentum equations taking account of the constraints imposed by faster time scale processes. The resultant plasma toroidal rotation equation includes the effects of collision-induced perpendicular viscosities, anomalous transport due to microturbulence in the plasma, momentum sources and collision-based parallel viscous forces due to 3D non-axisymmetric (NA) magnetic field components produced by external fields and MHD-type instabilities in the plasma. Non-resonant NA fields produce a toroidal torque throughout the plasma that relaxes the toroidal flow to an 'intrinsic' or 'offset' ion-temperature-gradient diamagnetic-type flow in the direction counter to the plasma current. A NA resonant field error causes a toroidal torque localized near its rational surface. The combination of resonant and non-resonant NA field components is found to predict scalings for error field penetration and mode locking thresholds that are in closer agreement with empirical data from tokamak plasmas.}

There are three typical onset conditions for these modes, given in order of increasing neoclassical drive required for mode onset: triggering by energetic particle modes, triggering by edge localized modes and cases where the modes appear to grow without a trigger. In all cases, the required drive increases with toroidal rotation shear, implying a stabilizing effect from the shear.}

  abstract={A real-time model-based controller is developed for the tracking of the distributed safety-factor profile in a tokamak plasma. Using relevant physical models and simplifying assumptions, theoretical stability and robustness guarantees were obtained using a Lyapunov function. This approach considers the couplings between the poloidal flux diffusion equation, the time-varying temperature profiles and an independent total plasma current control. The actuator chosen for the safety-factor profile tracking is the lower hybrid current drive, although the results presented can be easily extended to any non-inductive current source. The performance and robustness of the proposed control law is evaluated with a physics-oriented simulation code on Tore Supra experimental test cases.}

  abstract={An active plasma profile control approach for ITER, which is potentially robust by being tolerant to changing and uncertain physics, has been explored in this work, using a technique based on real-time estimation of linearized profile response models. The linearized models approximate static responses of the plasma profiles to power changes in auxiliary heating and current drive systems. These models are updated in real-time, differing from the model-based technique which deduces a dynamic model from identification experiments. The underlying physics is simplified with several assumptions to allow real-time update of the profile response models; however, without significant loss of information necessary for feedback control of the plasma profiles. The response of the electron temperature profile is modelled by simplifying the electron heat transport equation. The response of the safety factor profile is computed by directly relating it to the changes in source current density profiles. The required actuator power changes are directly computed by inverting the response matrix using the singular value decomposition technique. The saturation of the actuator powers is taken into account and the capability of using quantized auxiliary powers is provided. The potential of our active control approach has been tested by applying it to simulations of the ITER hybrid mode operation using CRONOS. In these simulations, either a global transport model or a theory-based local transport model has been used and the electron temperature and safety factor profiles were well controlled either independently or simultaneously.}

  abstract={A controller is designed for the tokamak safety factor profile that takes real-time-varying operational and physics limits into account. This so-called model predictive controller (MPC) employs a prediction model in order to compute optimal control inputs that satisfy the given limits. The use of linearized models around a reference trajectory results in a quadratic programming problem that can easily be solved online. The performance of the controller is analysed in a set of ITER L-mode scenarios simulated with the non-linear plasma transport code RAPTOR. It is shown that the controller can reduce the tracking error due to an overestimation or underestimation of the modelled transport, while making a trade-off between residual error and amount of controller action. It is also shown that the controller can account for a sudden decrease in the available actuator power, while providing warnings ahead of time about expected violations of operational and physics limits. This controller can be extended and implemented in existing tokamaks in the near future.}

The NSTX nominal plasma parameters are R 0 = 85 cm, a = 67 cm, R/a ≥ 1.26, B t = 3 kG, I p = 1 MA, q 95 = 14, elongation κ ≤ 2.2, triangularity δ ≤ 0.5 and a plasma pulse length of up to 5 s. The plasma heating/current drive tools are high harmonic fast wave (6 MW, 5 s), neutral beam injection (5 MW, 80 keV, 5 s) and coaxial helicity injection. Theoretical calculations predict that NSTX should provide exciting possibilities for exploring a number of important new physics regimes, including very high plasma β, naturally high plasma elongation, high bootstrap current fraction, absolute magnetic well and high pressure driven sheared flow. In addition, the NSTX programme plans to explore fully non-inductive plasma startup as well as a dispersive scrape-off layer for heat and particle flux handling.}

  abstract={Resistive wall mode (RWM) instabilities are found to be a limiting factor in advanced tokamak regimes with low internal inductance. Even small amplitude modes can affect the rotation profile and the performance of these ELMing H mode discharges. Although complete stabilization of the RWM by plasma rotation has not yet been observed, several discharges with increased beam momentum and power injection sustained good steady state performance for record durations. The first investigation of active feedback control of the RWM has shown promising results: the leakage of radial magnetic flux through the resistive wall can be successfully controlled and the duration of the high beta phase can be prolonged. The results provide a comparative test of several approaches to active feedback control, and are being used to benchmark the analysis and computational models of active control.}

  abstract={Two important effects of MHD fluctuations in the RFP and tokamak are current generation (the dynamo effect) and mode locking. In the T1 and MST RFP experiments new results reveal the mode dynamics underlying these phenomena. In T1 the effect of specific magnetic Fourier modes on the current density profile is evident. In MST, the MHD dynamo term ( delta v* delta B) is measured in the plasma edge, and found to account for the time dependence of the edge current throughout a sawtooth cycle. As edge resistivity is increased in T1 the fluctuation amplitude increases to maintain the dynamo-driven current, as expected from MHD computation. The modes responsible for the dynamo often lock to the local magnetic field error at the vertical cut in MST. The plasma rotation velocity has been measured with a fast Doppler spectrometer to a time resolution of 1 mu s. The plasma rotation and mode phase velocity are remarkably well-correlated, with both slowing, in the presence of an impulsive field error, in a 100 mu s timescale.}

  abstract={Dedicated experiments on TF ripple effects on the performance of tokamak plasmas have been carried out at JET. The TF ripple was found to have a profound effect on the plasma rotation. The central Mach number, M , defined as the ratio of the rotation velocity and the thermal velocity, was found to drop as a function of TF ripple amplitude (δ) from an average value of M = 0.40–0.55 for operations at the standard JET ripple of δ = 0.08% to M = 0.25–0.40 for δ = 0.5% and M = 0.1–0.3 for δ = 1%. TF ripple effects should be considered when estimating the plasma rotation in ITER. With standard co-current injection of neutral beam injection (NBI), plasmas were found to rotate in the co-current direction. However, for higher TF ripple amplitudes (δ ~ 1%) an area of counter rotation developed at the edge of the plasma, while the core kept its co-rotation. The edge counter rotation was found to depend, besides on the TF ripple amplitude, on the edge temperature. The observed reduction of toroidal plasma rotation with increasing TF ripple could partly be explained by TF ripple induced losses of energetic ions, injected by NBI. However, the calculated torque due to these losses was insufficient to explain the observed counter rotation and its scaling with edge parameters. It is suggested that additional TF ripple induced losses of thermal ions contribute to this effect.}

title={Principal component analysis in linear systems: Controllability, observability, and model reduction},
year={1981},
volume={26},
number={1},
pages={17-32},
abstract={Kalman's minimal realization theory involves geometric objects (controllable, unobservable subspaces) which are subject to structural instability. Specifically, arbitrarily small perturbations in a model may cause a change in the dimensions of the associated subspaces. This situation is manifested in computational difficulties which arise in attempts to apply textbook algorithms for computing a minimal realization. Structural instability associated with geometric theories is not unique to control; it arises in the theory of linear equations as well. In this setting, the computational problems have been studied for decades and excellent tools have been developed for coping with the situation. One of the main goals of this paper is to call attention to principal component analysis (Hotelling, 1933), and an algorithm (Golub and Reinsch, 1970) for computing the singular value decompositon of a matrix. Together they form a powerful tool for coping with structural instability in dynamic systems. As developed in this paper, principal component analysis is a technique for analyzing signals. (Singular value decomposition provides the computational machinery.) For this reason, Kalman's minimal realization theory is recast in terms of responses to injected signals. Application of the signal analysis to controllability and observability leads to a coordinate system in which the "internally balanced" model has special properties. For asymptotically stable systems, this yields working approximations ofX_{c}, X_{bar{o}}, the controllable and unobservable subspaces. It is proposed that a natural first step in model reduction is to apply the mechanics of minimal realization using these working subspaces.},

  abstract={Resistive wall mode (RWM) instabilities are found to be a limiting factor in advanced tokamak regimes with low internal inductance. Even small amplitude modes can affect the rotation profile and the performance of these ELMing H mode discharges. Although complete stabilization of the RWM by plasma rotation has not yet been observed, several discharges with increased beam momentum and power injection sustained good steady state performance for record durations. The first investigation of active feedback control of the RWM has shown promising results: the leakage of radial magnetic flux through the resistive wall can be successfully controlled and the duration of the high beta phase can be prolonged. The results provide a comparative test of several approaches to active feedback control, and are being used to benchmark the analysis and computational models of active control.}

  abstract={Two important effects of MHD fluctuations in the RFP and tokamak are current generation (the dynamo effect) and mode locking. In the T1 and MST RFP experiments new results reveal the mode dynamics underlying these phenomena. In T1 the effect of specific magnetic Fourier modes on the current density profile is evident. In MST, the MHD dynamo term ( delta v* delta B) is measured in the plasma edge, and found to account for the time dependence of the edge current throughout a sawtooth cycle. As edge resistivity is increased in T1 the fluctuation amplitude increases to maintain the dynamo-driven current, as expected from MHD computation. The modes responsible for the dynamo often lock to the local magnetic field error at the vertical cut in MST. The plasma rotation velocity has been measured with a fast Doppler spectrometer to a time resolution of 1 mu s. The plasma rotation and mode phase velocity are remarkably well-correlated, with both slowing, in the presence of an impulsive field error, in a 100 mu s timescale.}

  abstract={Dedicated experiments on TF ripple effects on the performance of tokamak plasmas have been carried out at JET. The TF ripple was found to have a profound effect on the plasma rotation. The central Mach number, M , defined as the ratio of the rotation velocity and the thermal velocity, was found to drop as a function of TF ripple amplitude (δ) from an average value of M = 0.40–0.55 for operations at the standard JET ripple of δ = 0.08% to M = 0.25–0.40 for δ = 0.5% and M = 0.1–0.3 for δ = 1%. TF ripple effects should be considered when estimating the plasma rotation in ITER. With standard co-current injection of neutral beam injection (NBI), plasmas were found to rotate in the co-current direction. However, for higher TF ripple amplitudes (δ ~ 1%) an area of counter rotation developed at the edge of the plasma, while the core kept its co-rotation. The edge counter rotation was found to depend, besides on the TF ripple amplitude, on the edge temperature. The observed reduction of toroidal plasma rotation with increasing TF ripple could partly be explained by TF ripple induced losses of energetic ions, injected by NBI. However, the calculated torque due to these losses was insufficient to explain the observed counter rotation and its scaling with edge parameters. It is suggested that additional TF ripple induced losses of thermal ions contribute to this effect.}

title={Principal component analysis in linear systems: Controllability, observability, and model reduction},
year={1981},
volume={26},
number={1},
pages={17-32},
abstract={Kalman's minimal realization theory involves geometric objects (controllable, unobservable subspaces) which are subject to structural instability. Specifically, arbitrarily small perturbations in a model may cause a change in the dimensions of the associated subspaces. This situation is manifested in computational difficulties which arise in attempts to apply textbook algorithms for computing a minimal realization. Structural instability associated with geometric theories is not unique to control; it arises in the theory of linear equations as well. In this setting, the computational problems have been studied for decades and excellent tools have been developed for coping with the situation. One of the main goals of this paper is to call attention to principal component analysis (Hotelling, 1933), and an algorithm (Golub and Reinsch, 1970) for computing the singular value decompositon of a matrix. Together they form a powerful tool for coping with structural instability in dynamic systems. As developed in this paper, principal component analysis is a technique for analyzing signals. (Singular value decomposition provides the computational machinery.) For this reason, Kalman's minimal realization theory is recast in terms of responses to injected signals. Application of the signal analysis to controllability and observability leads to a coordinate system in which the "internally balanced" model has special properties. For asymptotically stable systems, this yields working approximations ofX_{c}, X_{bar{o}}, the controllable and unobservable subspaces. It is proposed that a natural first step in model reduction is to apply the mechanics of minimal realization using these working subspaces.},

There are three typical onset conditions for these modes, given in order of increasing neoclassical drive required for mode onset: triggering by energetic particle modes, triggering by edge localized modes and cases where the modes appear to grow without a trigger. In all cases, the required drive increases with toroidal rotation shear, implying a stabilizing effect from the shear.}

The plasma heating/current drive tools are high harmonic fast wave (6 MW, 5 s), neutral beam injection (5 MW, 80 keV, 5 s) and coaxial helicity injection. Theoretical calculations predict that NSTX should provide exciting possibilities for exploring a number of important new physics regimes, including very high plasma β, naturally high plasma elongation, high bootstrap current fraction, absolute magnetic well and high pressure driven sheared flow. In addition, the NSTX programme plans to explore fully non-inductive plasma startup as well as a dispersive scrape-off layer for heat and particle flux handling.}

  abstract={Resistive wall mode (RWM) instabilities are found to be a limiting factor in advanced tokamak regimes with low internal inductance. Even small amplitude modes can affect the rotation profile and the performance of these ELMing H mode discharges. Although complete stabilization of the RWM by plasma rotation has not yet been observed, several discharges with increased beam momentum and power injection sustained good steady state performance for record durations. The first investigation of active feedback control of the RWM has shown promising results: the leakage of radial magnetic flux through the resistive wall can be successfully controlled and the duration of the high beta phase can be prolonged. The results provide a comparative test of several approaches to active feedback control, and are being used to benchmark the analysis and computational models of active control.}

  abstract={Two important effects of MHD fluctuations in the RFP and tokamak are current generation (the dynamo effect) and mode locking. In the T1 and MST RFP experiments new results reveal the mode dynamics underlying these phenomena. In T1 the effect of specific magnetic Fourier modes on the current density profile is evident. In MST, the MHD dynamo term ( delta v* delta B) is measured in the plasma edge, and found to account for the time dependence of the edge current throughout a sawtooth cycle. As edge resistivity is increased in T1 the fluctuation amplitude increases to maintain the dynamo-driven current, as expected from MHD computation. The modes responsible for the dynamo often lock to the local magnetic field error at the vertical cut in MST. The plasma rotation velocity has been measured with a fast Doppler spectrometer to a time resolution of 1 mu s. The plasma rotation and mode phase velocity are remarkably well-correlated, with both slowing, in the presence of an impulsive field error, in a 100 mu s timescale.}

  abstract={Dedicated experiments on TF ripple effects on the performance of tokamak plasmas have been carried out at JET. The TF ripple was found to have a profound effect on the plasma rotation. The central Mach number, M , defined as the ratio of the rotation velocity and the thermal velocity, was found to drop as a function of TF ripple amplitude (δ) from an average value of M = 0.40–0.55 for operations at the standard JET ripple of δ = 0.08% to M = 0.25–0.40 for δ = 0.5% and M = 0.1–0.3 for δ = 1%. TF ripple effects should be considered when estimating the plasma rotation in ITER. With standard co-current injection of neutral beam injection (NBI), plasmas were found to rotate in the co-current direction. However, for higher TF ripple amplitudes (δ ~ 1%) an area of counter rotation developed at the edge of the plasma, while the core kept its co-rotation. The edge counter rotation was found to depend, besides on the TF ripple amplitude, on the edge temperature. The observed reduction of toroidal plasma rotation with increasing TF ripple could partly be explained by TF ripple induced losses of energetic ions, injected by NBI. However, the calculated torque due to these losses was insufficient to explain the observed counter rotation and its scaling with edge parameters. It is suggested that additional TF ripple induced losses of thermal ions contribute to this effect.}

title={Principal component analysis in linear systems: Controllability, observability, and model reduction},
year={1981},
volume={26},
number={1},
pages={17-32},
abstract={Kalman's minimal realization theory involves geometric objects (controllable, unobservable subspaces) which are subject to structural instability. Specifically, arbitrarily small perturbations in a model may cause a change in the dimensions of the associated subspaces. This situation is manifested in computational difficulties which arise in attempts to apply textbook algorithms for computing a minimal realization. Structural instability associated with geometric theories is not unique to control; it arises in the theory of linear equations as well. In this setting, the computational problems have been studied for decades and excellent tools have been developed for coping with the situation. One of the main goals of this paper is to call attention to principal component analysis (Hotelling, 1933), and an algorithm (Golub and Reinsch, 1970) for computing the singular value decompositon of a matrix. Together they form a powerful tool for coping with structural instability in dynamic systems. As developed in this paper, principal component analysis is a technique for analyzing signals. (Singular value decomposition provides the computational machinery.) For this reason, Kalman's minimal realization theory is recast in terms of responses to injected signals. Application of the signal analysis to controllability and observability leads to a coordinate system in which the "internally balanced" model has special properties. For asymptotically stable systems, this yields working approximations ofX_{c}, X_{bar{o}}, the controllable and unobservable subspaces. It is proposed that a natural first step in model reduction is to apply the mechanics of minimal realization using these working subspaces.},

  abstract={In this work we develop an artificial neural network (ANN) for the feedback stabilization of a thermonuclear reactor at nearly ignited burn conditions. A volume-averaged zero-dimensional nonlinear model is used to represent the time evolution of the electron density, the relative density of alpha particles and the temperature of the plasma, where a particular scaling law for the energy confinement time previously used by other authors, was adopted. The control actions include the concurrent modulation of the D-T refuelling rate, the injection of a neutral He-4 beam and an auxiliary heating power modulation, which are constrained to take values within a maximum and minimum levels. For this purpose a feedforward multilayer artificial neural network with sigmoidal activation function is trained using a back-propagation through-time technique. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the behaviour of the resulting ANN-dynamical system configuration. It is concluded that the resulting ANN can successfully stabilize the nonlinear model of the thermonuclear reactor at nearly ignited conditions for temperature and density departures significantly far from their nominal operating values. The NN-dynamical system configuration is shown to be robust with respect to the thermalization time of the alpha particles for perturbations within the region used to train the NN.}

  abstract={In order for ITER to be capable of operating in advanced tokamak operating regimes, characterized by a high fusion gain, good plasma confinement, magnetohydrodynamic stability and a non-inductively driven plasma current, for extended periods of time, several challenging plasma control problems still need to be solved. Setting up a suitable toroidal current density profile in the tokamak is key for one possible advanced operating scenario characterized by non-inductive sustainment of the plasma current. At the DIII-D tokamak, the goal is to create the desired current profile during the ramp-up and early flat-top phases of the plasma discharge and then actively maintain this target profile for the remainder of the discharge. The evolution in time of the toroidal current profile in tokamaks is related to the evolution of the poloidal magnetic flux profile, which is modelled in normalized cylindrical coordinates using a first-principles, nonlinear, dynamic partial differential equation (PDE) referred to as the magnetic diffusion equation. The magnetic diffusion equation is combined with empirical correlations developed from physical observations and experimental data from DIII-D for the electron temperature, the plasma resistivity and the non-inductive current drive to develop a simplified, control-oriented, nonlinear, dynamic PDE model of the poloidal flux profile evolution valid for low confinement mode discharges. In this work, we synthesize a robust feedback controller to reject disturbances and track a desired reference trajectory of the poloidal magnetic flux gradient profile by employing the control-oriented model of the system. A singular value decomposition of the static gain matrix of the plant model is utilized to identify the most relevant control channels and is combined with the dynamic response of system around a given operating trajectory to design the feedback controller. A general framework for real-time feedforward + feedback control of magnetic and kinetic plasma profiles was implemented in the DIII-D Plasma Control System and was used to demonstrate the ability of the feedback controller to control the toroidal current profile evolution in the DIII-D tokamak. These experiments constitute the first time ever a first-principles-driven, model-based, closed-loop magnetic profile controller was successfully implemented and tested in a tokamak device.}

  abstract={A comprehensive transport equation for the evolution of toroidal rotation in tokamak plasmas is developed self-consistently from the two-fluid momentum equations taking account of the constraints imposed by faster time scale processes. The resultant plasma toroidal rotation equation includes the effects of collision-induced perpendicular viscosities, anomalous transport due to microturbulence in the plasma, momentum sources and collision-based parallel viscous forces due to 3D non-axisymmetric (NA) magnetic field components produced by external fields and MHD-type instabilities in the plasma. Non-resonant NA fields produce a toroidal torque throughout the plasma that relaxes the toroidal flow to an 'intrinsic' or 'offset' ion-temperature-gradient diamagnetic-type flow in the direction counter to the plasma current. A NA resonant field error causes a toroidal torque localized near its rational surface. The combination of resonant and non-resonant NA field components is found to predict scalings for error field penetration and mode locking thresholds that are in closer agreement with empirical data from tokamak plasmas.}

  abstract={Physics knowledge in plasma confinement and transport relevant to design of a reactor-scale tokamak is reviewed and methodologies for projecting confinement properties to ITER are provided. Theoretical approaches to describing a turbulent plasma transport in a tokamak are outlined and phenomenology of major energy confinement regimes observed in tokamaks, including those with edge and internal transport barriers, is described. The chapter is focused on the energy confinement in the high confinement regime (H-mode) with the edge localized MHD modes, the basic operational regime of ITER. Three approaches are being pursued: (i) derivation of empirical global scaling laws; (ii) non-dimensionally similar studies; and (iii) one dimensional transport modelling codes, with the first approach recommended as the most robust at the present time. Special attention is paid to analysis of uncertainties in confinement predictions. Empirical scaling relations for projecting the L-mode to H-mode power threshold based on regression analysis of an extensive database are discussed. Particle and toroidal momentum confinement and their relation to energy confinement are reviewed.}

  abstract={Systematic and statistical studies have been conducted in order to develop an understanding of the parametric dependences of both the global and thermal energy confinement times at low aspect ratio in high power National Spherical Torus Experiment discharges. The global and thermal confinement times of both L- and H-mode discharges can exceed values given by H-mode scalings developed for conventional aspect ratio. Results of systematic scans in the H-mode indicate that the confinement times exhibit a nearly linear dependence on plasma current and a power degradation weaker than that observed at conventional aspect ratio. In addition, the dependence on the toroidal magnetic field is stronger than that seen in conventional aspect ratio tokamaks. This latter trend is also evident in statistical analyses of the available dataset. These statistical studies also indicate a weaker parametric dependence on plasma current than found in the systematic scans, due to correlations among the predictor variables. Regressions based on engineering variables, when transformed to dimensionless physics variables, indicate that the dependence of B τ E on β t can range from being negative to null. Regressions based directly on the dimensionless physics variables are inexact because of large correlations among these variables. Scatter in the confinement data, at otherwise fixed operating parameters, is found to be due to variations in ELM activity, low frequency density fluctuations and plasma shaping.}

  abstract = "A set of numerical techniques for calculating heat and particle source rates due to neutral beam injection in axisymmetric tokamaks is described. While these techniques consume a substantial amount of computer time, they take into account a number of significant, and normally neglected, effects. Examples of these effects are reionization of escaping charge exchanged beam particles, finite fast ion orbit excursions, beam deposition through collisions of beam neutrals with circulating beam ions, and the transport of thermal neutrals in the plasma due to charge changing collisions with beam ions.

  abstract={A model-based feedback system is presented to control plasma rotation in a magnetically confined toroidal fusion device, to maintain plasma stability for long-pulse operation. This research uses experimental measurements from the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) and is aimed at controlling plasma rotation using two different types of actuation: momentum from injected neutral beams and neoclassical toroidal viscosity generated by three-dimensional applied magnetic fields. Based on the data-driven model obtained, a feedback controller is designed, and predictive simulations using the TRANSP plasma transport code show that the controller is able to attain desired plasma rotation profiles given practical constraints on the actuators and the available measurements of rotation.}
